# Dev Log "Green Goblin"

Total Time (Hours): 17 Hours

## Week 1 (07/14/2025) - 6 Hours

Days worked on:

Monday – 1 hour<br>
Tuesday – 30 minutes<br>
Wednesday – 2 hours<br>
Thursday – 1 hour and 30 minutes<br>
Friday – 1 hour

- Began with concept (Watch a lot of YouTube videos to get an idea) 
- Started to select parts like motor, servos, and parachute (Servos were changed many times due to strengh of output) 
- Decided to choose the Aerotech G74W-9 motor as the size is perfect (29mm)  
- Estimated some altitude calculations using RockSim (2,000 feet)
- Start modeling the nose cone and servo mounts in Fusion 360

Days worked on:

Monday - 2 hours<br>
Tuesday - 1 hour<br>

- Designed the entire bottom section of the rocket, including servo mounts, fin mounts, and bottom end 
- Did research on what to make the outer skin of the rocket of (Chose PETG instead of PLA) 
- Decided to also reinforce the airframe with fiberglass cloth and resin 
- Decided where electronics will go and where bulkheads will be placed  
- Started to build the ejection charge tube
- Messed up on tolerance of the ejection charge tube as it was too small (FIXED)
