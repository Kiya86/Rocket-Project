# *Green Goblin*

### A highly advanced rocket equipped with four controllable fins for real-time control. The rocket utilizes a PETG airframe that will be reinforced with fiberglass cloth and resin.

### The inner structure of teh rocket is similar to the outer skin, but rather made out of PETG without fiberglass reinforcement. The rocket is able to house one 29mm motor up to 220 mm long due to servos being a constraint.

### The PCB of the rocket uses multiple sensors, such as the MPU9250, BMP581 and the AHT21. The PCB also uses LoRa to communicate with a ground station with another ESP32. The flight computer can be used in any rocket as long as it fits!

PCB will be paid for by an onboard grant and will be created soon! Hopefully it works...

### Why did I make this rocket?

I am way too passionate about rockets. Like every since immigrating to the US I have been wanting to build RC planes and rockets, and it's finally time!
