# ðŸš€ Project MightyMouse â€“ Actively Stabilized High-Power Rocket

**Project MightyMouse** is a fully custom, actively stabilized high-power rocket built from the ground up for TRA/NAR Level 2 certification. Featuring custom avionics on a 4-layer PCB, a hand-made fiberglass airframe, live telemetry, and even custom-formulated rocket motors, this rocket was engineered for maximum performance and modularity. The vehicle uses active stabilization with 4 fins and a reaction wheel, deploys parachutes via pyro channels, and sends live data to a custom-built ground station.
